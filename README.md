# PostMaker

**PostMaker** is a terminal-based API client inspired by Postman, for developers who prefer the command line. It supports sending HTTP requests, managing collections, variables, history, assertions, chaining, diffing, templates, import/export, and more.

---

## Features

- Send HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
- Save requests to collections or as global aliases
- Send saved requests by alias (from collections or global aliases)
- Use variables in URLs, headers, and bodies
- View and replay request history
- Pretty-print and syntax highlight JSON and HTML responses and headers
- Assertions for status codes and response content, with optional script execution
- Chain requests from a file
- Diff responses from history or files
- Manage collections, global aliases, and variables (add, remove, clear)
- Import/export requests as cURL commands
- Authentication helpers (Bearer, Basic)
- Output responses to files (with auto-naming for batch requests)
- Templates: Save and reuse request templates with placeholders
- Import/export all data (collections, aliases, variables, templates)
- View and manage templates
- Interactive request builder
- View global aliases
- Cat files (view file contents in terminal)
- Script runner: Run custom Python scripts after assertions pass (edit scripts in `scripts/` directory)

### Making a Request

```sh
request -m GET -u https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1
```

**Options and Expected Output:**

- `-m, --method` (required) — HTTP method  
  *Example:* `-m POST`  
  *Expected output:* Sends a POST request.

- `-u, --url` (required) — Request URL (can be a file with URLs)  
  *Example:* `-u https://api.example.com/data`  
  *Expected output:* Sends request to the specified URL.

- `-hd, --headers` — Headers as JSON string or `@file.json`  
  *Example:* `-hd '{"Authorization": "Bearer token"}'`  
  *Expected output:* Adds headers to the request.

- `-d, --data` — Body as JSON string or `@file.json`  
  *Example:* `-d '{"key": "value"}'`  
  *Expected output:* Sends JSON body.

- `-o, --output` — Output response to file  
  *Example:* `-o output.txt`  
  *Expected output:* Writes the response to `output.txt`.

- `--only` — Output only `body`, `headers`, or `status`  
  *Example:* `--only body`  
  *Expected output:* Prints only the response body.

- `--auth` — Authentication helper: `"bearer TOKEN"` or `"basic USER:PASS"`  
  *Example:* `--auth "bearer mytoken"`  
  *Expected output:* Adds Authorization header.

- `--assert` — Assertion, e.g. `status=200` or `body_contains=foo`  
  *Example:* `--assert status=200`  
  *Expected output:* Prints assertion result after request.

- `-p, --preview` — Preview request before sending  
  *Example:* `-p`  
  *Expected output:* Shows request details and asks for confirmation.

- `-fv, --fillvars` — Fill placeholders in the request (prompt for variables)  
  *Example:* `-fv`  
  *Expected output:* Prompts for variable values used in the request.

**Examples:**
```sh
request -m POST -u https://api.example.com/data -hd '{"Authorization": "Bearer token"}' -d '{"key": "value"}'
request -m GET -u urls.txt
request -m GET -u https://api.example.com/data --auth "bearer mytoken"
request -m GET -u https://api.example.com/data --auth "basic user:pass"
request -m GET -u https://api.example.com/data --assert status=200
request -m GET -u https://api.example.com/data --only body
request -m GET -u https://api.example.com/data -p
request -m GET -u "https://api.example.com/{{endpoint}}" -fv
```

### Assertions and Script Runner

You can add assertions to requests to automatically check the response.  
**Supported assertions:**
- `status=CODE` — Check if the response status code matches.
- `body_contains=STRING` — Check if the response body contains a substring.

**You can also run a custom script if the assertion passes.**  
Scripts are located in the `scripts/` directory (e.g., `scripts/1.py` to `scripts/5.py`).  
You can edit these scripts to perform any custom action.

**Syntax:**
```sh
request -m GET -u https://api.example.com/data --assert status=200,1
```
- The number after the comma specifies which script to run (1-5).
- **Important:** There must be **no space** between the assertion condition and the comma/script number.  
  For example: `--assert status=200,1` is correct, but `--assert status=200, 1` will not work.

**Expected output:**
- If the assertion passes:  
  `Assertion passed: status=200`  
  Then, the specified script (e.g., `scripts/1.py`) will be executed.
- If the assertion fails:  
  `Assertion failed: status=404 (expected 200)`

**You can edit the scripts in the `scripts/` directory to customize what happens when an assertion passes.**

**Examples:**
```sh
request -m GET -u https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1 --assert status=200,1
request -m GET -u https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1 --assert body_contains=title,2
```

---

### Using Variables

Set a variable:
```sh
setvar base_url https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
```
*Expected output:*  
`Variable 'base_url' set.`

View variables:
```sh
vars
```
*Expected output:*  
A JSON object of all variables.

Use variables in requests:
```sh
request -m GET -u "{{base_url}}/posts/1"
```

Remove or clear variables:
```sh
vars -rm base_url
vars -cl
```
*Expected output:*  
Confirmation prompt and removal/clearing of variables.

---

### Collections and Global Aliases

Save a request to a collection:
```sh
save -c mycollection -a myalias -m GET -u https://api.example.com/data
```
*Expected output:*  
`Request saved as 'myalias' in collection 'mycollection'.`

Save as a global alias:
```sh
save -a myalias -m GET -u https://api.example.com/data
```
*Expected output:*  
`Request saved as global alias 'myalias'.`

List collections:
```sh

```
*Expected output:*  
Adds the appropriate Authorization header.

---

### Output and Highlighting

- All JSON and HTML responses and headers are syntax highlighted.
- Output to file: Use `-o output.txt` to save the response.
- Use `--only` to print only the body, headers, or status.

---

### Templates

Templates let you save and reuse request blueprints with placeholders.

Save a template:

## Testing API

You can use the included `testAPI.py` Flask app to test PostMaker locally:

```sh
python testAPI.py
```

---

## Tips

- Use variables for anything that repeats (base URLs, tokens, IDs).
- Use collections and global aliases to organize and reuse requests.
- Use history and diff to debug and compare responses.
- Use assertions to automate API checks.
- Use output files to save responses for further analysis.
- Use `importcurl` and `exportcurl` to work with cURL commands.
- Use templates for requests with placeholders.
- Use the script runner for automation or advanced workflows.
- Use `interactive` for guided request building.
- **Edit scripts in the `scripts/` directory to customize what happens after assertions pass.**
